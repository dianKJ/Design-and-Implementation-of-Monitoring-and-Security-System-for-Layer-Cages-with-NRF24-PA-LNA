Position			:	Main Designer	

Jobdesc	:	Design and manufacturing electronic system, do testing (power, distance of NRF), Programming and installing device.

Project Type	:	Final Project.

Microcontroller	:	Arduino Nano V3.

Software (Electronics)	:	Eagle and Proteus

Software (Programming)	:	Arduino IDE

Component	:	NRF24L01+PA+LNA, Arduino Nano, DHT-11, MQ-135, YL-69

Description		  :		The final project of monitoring chicken coops with NRF24 + PA + LNA is to monitor air quality and safety. Using the MQ sensor to check ammonia levels, soil moisture sensors, humidity and temperature sensors, and proximity sensors as safety sensor. All sensor data are packaged and sent in a data packet from the enclosure to the owner's house using the NRF24L01 + PA + LNA. Owner can activate the safety mode from the receiver that placed at owner home.

Performance	:	Device run properly can measure the ammonia and another sensor. It can communicate (Transmitter and Receiver) in 800m range. Data that send is equal with data received. Device able to work continuously
Facilitator	:	Electrical Installation laboratory Gadjah Mada University
